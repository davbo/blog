This morning I decided to visit the public gallery in the houses of parliament.
Part of me was hoping it may help with my current disillusionment at British
politics. Sadly it hasn't, so far at least, but I do highly recommend visiting
if you have the opportunity.

Thursday morning seems to be generally quiet but I thought I'd go and see oral
questions to the department for exiting the EU, they must have been busy, right?

Well, [Eddie Hughes (Conservative MP for Walsall North) asked][so busy] what
specific actions had been taken to prepare for a possible no deal exit - and of
course there were so many they couldn't possibly list them.

## Those vital data flows ##

What's the effect called where a topic you know a bit about is discussed at high
profile and everything seems quite wrong. It leaves you feeling like topics you
don't know quite so well must be similarly poorly presented all the time,
unnoticed to yourself. If it does have a name, please let me know.

[Jeremy Lefroy (Conservative MP for Stafford) spoke][lefroy question] about the
importance of data flows (?), something we all of course feel strongly about. He
raised a good point that even if we leave the EU with a deal, the UK will no
longer have influence over GDPR which has major impact beyond the EU.

Stephen Barclay (Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union) ~~answered~~
responded saying lots of undersea cables flowing with data come into the UK and
we've got lots and lots of data centres. No idea how it's related, there even
seemed to be a veiled threat about stopping the "flow of data".

One thing he said seemed not only irrelevant but very off the mark: "40% of EU
data centres are in the UK" This doesn't sound right at all to me. Here's a look
at the numbers for major public cloud providers: Amazon, Google and Microsoft.

[1/5 of Amazon's Europe based regions are in the UK (London)][amazon regions].

[2/14 of Microsoft Azure's Europe based regions are in the UK (UK South & UK West)][azure regions].

[1/6 of Google Cloud Platform's Europe based regions are in the UK (London)][gcp regions].

Some of these include non-EU regions (usually Switzerland) but that isn't the
point. Also, I'm aware not all of these regions are created equally.

If a business operates from any one of these data centre's they could just as
easily migrate their workload entirely to another - a feature of cloud computing
which continues to be easier over time. That's one of the huge selling points of
this cloud stuff. Viewing the number of data centre's in the UK as some kind of
leverage in negotiation seems shockingly ill-informed.

It's not possible to contrast the number of data centre's in the UK with the
ability to influence powerful regulations like the GDPR.

Oh well, at least the gift shop sold beer.
